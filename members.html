 <p>Hello, my name is Latasha  and I currently attend Jones College Prep. While maintaining an athletic career as a varsity track sprinter, I have continued to strive for excellence in both my academics and extracurriculars. Recently, I have
            been selected to attend the 2017 Presidential Inauguration as a result of my outstanding grades and dedication to the field of science and technology. Also, I am a founder of a creative club at my school called The Positivity Club that embodies
            community service. Coming from a lower class family with little college experience, I hope to get the opportunity to run collegiate track to honor all of the sacrifices my family has made for me. My hard work ethic will bring leadership, teamwork,
            and motivation to everything I try to accomplish. Sprinting is my passion and I dream of running at a college level.</p>

 <p>My name is Brian Foxx Jr., and my favorite subject in school is Geometry. One of the activities I participate in at school is football. I do not have a part time job, and I do not currently volunteer for anything. This school year, I was recognized for being one of three students in the sophomore class at my school to get a top score on the International Baccalaureate Personal Project. My score was a 7/7. For my Personal Project, I built a computer. My favorite hobby is working with computers. I really enjoy building them. Anything that deals with technology is of interest to me. I am most passionate about computers and computer science, so this is why I would love to learn coding. My career goal is to work in the field of technology.</p>
