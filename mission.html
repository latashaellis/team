        <p class"mp"> Our mission at CoderSpace is to work in teams to design and build websites for local clients while gaining real world experience in web development, teamwork and leadership. Together as a team we would like to succesfully complete a responsive website for a real-world client. We will also like to further develop our leadership, team-working, and presentation skills. We believe that "teamwork makes the dream work". Furthermore the CodePanthers would like the further their knowledge in several coding languages including HTML, CSS, and JAVASCRIPT.
